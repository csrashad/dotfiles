# SymLinks

Items that are here are to be used as symlinks. For example, `vim` looks for a `~/.vimrc` file if you have any personal settings. Common settings I like inlcude sharing the clipboard and smart indents. Make your ` ~/.vimrc` file a symlink to `./vimrc`. That way I get all the benefits of my custom `vim` configurations and any changes I make along the way are much more portable. 

Why not including the `.` prefix on files here. I've come into issue forgetting to run `ls -a` over `ls`
