# Dotfiles

On my personal linux bash based shell, I did alot of setup to enjoy the terminal. The zsh mac terminal sucks butt out of the gate. I don't necessarily need to make it at the level of my bash dotfiles but that would be a cool idea.

## Basic Goals

Why does the mac terminal feel so bad to me right now? What am I missing?

1. A nice ps1 (where am I? time of last command. git information).
2. Nice completions in the terminal
3. Good fuzzy find for completing commands
4. `ls` shoud look nice
5. Vim should be nice as well
6. Need file navigation such as `ranger` or similar
