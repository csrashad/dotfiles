## Got a new terminal and it sucks. Get up and running

This could potentially become a script in the future. For now, this document represents my notes of getting that stuff I want to be up and running and do so manually, while providing the links for ease of researching again.

## ps1

### ohmyzsh

[ohmyzsh](https://github.com/ohmyzsh/ohmyzsh)

```
sh -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ohmyzsh/ohmyzsh/master/tools/install.sh)"
```
